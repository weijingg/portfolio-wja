### <a href="amazon_pub.qmd" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Mapping floodplain depths</a>

The depth of 12 lakes along the Amazon River was estimated using flooding frequency, with areas that flood more being expected to be deeper. Depth data is valuable for ecological and hydrological research, such as determining biodiversity distribution and modeling water stratification.

### <a href="lakes_pub.qmd" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Lake behaviour</a>

As lake depth rises and falls with seasonal rainfall each year, the surface area of the lake grows and recedes correspondingly. One might expect a linear relationship between these two variables, yet a complex loop is observed. Understanding the controls behind this phenomenon sheds light on the geomorphic characteristics of large floodplain lakes.

### <a href="dams_pub.qmd" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Dam distribution analysis</a>

Dams have burgeoned in the Mekong, but information on dams is scattered and inconsistent. Up-to-date evaluation of dams is unavailable, and basin-wide hydropower potential has yet to be systematically assessed. We present a comprehensive database of 1055 dams, a spatiotemporal analysis of the dams, and a total hydropower potential of 1,334,683 MW. Considering projected dam development and hydropower potential, the vulnerability and the need for better dam management may be highest in Laos.
