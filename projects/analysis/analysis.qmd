### <a href="chicago.qmd" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Predictive modelling</a>

The Chicago Department of Public Health seeks to optimize the allocation of limited health inspectors across the many food establishments in the city. This project presents **ChicaGo!**, a new application that **predicts food establishments most at risk of failing inspections**. By prioritizing these establishments, the health department can direct inspection efforts towards where they are most needed.
