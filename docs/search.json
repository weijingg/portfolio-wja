    "text": "Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There (1871), are two of the most beloved works in English literature. Both books follow the adventures of a young girl named Alice as she journeys through fantastical and often nonsensical worlds.\nIn Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a magical realm filled with peculiar characters such as the Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter. The story is known for its whimsical narrative and exploration of themes like curiosity, identity, and the absurdity of adult rules.\nThrough the Looking-Glass serves as a sequel but is distinct in tone and structure. Alice, now half a year older, steps through a mirror into a world that operates like a giant chessboard, where she encounters figures such as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the Red and White Queens. This book is darker and more introspective, with greater emphasis on the loss of childhood innocence and transition into adulthood.\nThis project compares the dominant sentiments and emotional tones across the two books, revealing patterns on their emotional depth and narrative structure, and offering fresh insights into Carroll’s imaginative storytelling.\nSentiment analysis involves extracting emotions expressed in text. A sentiment lexicon is a collection of words, each associated with a score indicating its positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Various lexicons (e.g. NRC, AFINN, Syuzhet) are used to analyze sentiment scores. Both texts are split into paragraphs and several paragraphs are grouped as one corpus entry. To account for uneven word counts across entries, the total sentiment score of each entry is weighed by the number of terms and normalized.\n\nAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland\nIn Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, the words that appear the most frequently include “came”, “went”, “looked”, “think”, and “say”. These words are simple verbs, which can be expected in a work primarily written as a children’s book. These verbs are also fitting in the story’s context, considering that it is about an adventure that involves meeting many new characters.\n\nLooking at the main sentiment identified across the paragraphs (using the NRC sentiment lexicon), positive sentiments are the most common, as expected from a children’s book, followed by negative sentiments, likely when Alice encounters strange situations and characters in her dream. There is a wide range of sentiments, including anger, anticipation, fear, sadness, surprise, and trust, suggesting that the work is emotionally-rich and expressive.\n\nThe constant variation in emotional intensity across the book could be what creates suspense in the story, keeping readers engaged and in anticipation of what will happen next. In particular, the overall sentiment intensity is higher towards the end of the story when Alice encounters the Queen of Hearts (who threatens her) and wakes up in a shock.\n\nThe same frightful encounter with the Queen is evident when using the AFINN lexicon, where there is a strong negative score right before the somewhat positive ending.\n\n\n\nThrough the Looking-Glass\nIn Through the Looking-Glass, the most frequently occurring words include “like,” “now,” “last,” “always,” and “good”. Compared to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, these words convey a more mature tone and are less expressive. With simple verbs appearing less often, the story feels less adventurous and whimsical.\n\n\n\n The more subdued tone is also evident in the main sentiments identified across the paragraphs. While positive sentiments are still the most common, followed by negative sentiments, there is a smaller range of sentiments compared to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland despite the longer text. Anticipation stands out as the third most frequent emotion, primarily expressed through the structure of the chess game as Alice progresses through the squares.\nInterestingly, while the first book had sadness as a main sentiment in several corpus entries, the sequel has joy as a main sentiment, suggesting that while the second book is more mature and explores the transition from childhood to adulthood, it is not necessarily somber in tone.\n\nLike in the first story, the emotional intensity varies across the book, keeping readers engaged. The intensity peaks when Alice, now the queen, argues with the Red and White Queens, who insist that Alice throw a party, yet deny her the right to invite her own guests. Although Alice wants to be a queen throughout the story, actually becoming a queen was not as enjoyable as she expected. The party is seen as a metaphor for adulthood, which appears desirable during childhood, yet not what one might expect upon growing up (LitCharts, 2024).\n\nThis strong negative sentiment during the party is also seen when using other lexicons like Syuzhet. The sentiment score generally increases from negative to positive after the argument, and the story ends on a positive note, when Alice wakes up and chats with her cats about her dream.\nAnother strong negative sentiment is captured when Tweedledee and Tweedledum tell Alice that she is not real but just a character within the dream of the Red King, and Alice cries as she questions her existence and reality. This section of the story also challenges the readers to question reality, free will, and the notion of existence as a fragment of divine imagination (SparkNotes, 2024).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nOverall, Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has a more mature and subdued tone, though not necessarily somber. In contrast, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland carries a more adventure-like and light-hearted tone, evoking childhood innocence. This sense of wonder diminishes in the second book, as Alice learns about adulthood and comes to accept the sometimes questionable world for what it is.\nBoth books feature a dynamic range of emotional intensity, exploring a fairly broad spectrum of feelings. This emotional variation may be what has drawn so many readers to these timeless works and could be the key to their enduring success.\n\n\nReferences\nLitChart, 2024.

    "text": "Dams have proliferated along the Mekong, spurred by energy demands from economic development and capital from private companies. Swift dam evolution has rendered many databases outdated, and without a comprehensive database, up-to-date spatial assessment of dam growth is unavailable.\nIn this paper, we offer (1) an open-access and unified database of 1055 dams, (2) a spatiotemporal analysis of dams from the 1980s to the post-2020s, and (3) a grid-based assessment of the theoretical hydropower potential using modelled discharge in the present-day and in the future.\nThe dam count of 1055 is more than twice the largest existing database. While China had the largest capacity increase from the 2000s to the 2010s, Laos has the most planned dams and the highest projected growth. Based on present-day discharge, we estimate a basin-wide hydropower potential of 1,334,683 MW, where Laos is the highest at 514,887 MW. Based on future discharge modeled with climate change, hydropower potential could grow to over 2,000,000 MW.\nOur database facilitates research on dam-induced hydrological and ecological alterations, while spatiotemporal analysis of hydropower capacity could illuminate the complex transboundary electricity trade. We address the vulnerability of countries to dam construction, highlighting the need for better planning and management in the future hydropower hotspot Laos.\n\nAng, W. J., Park, E., Tran, D.

    "text": "The Amazon is the world’s largest river by volume of water. Flowing from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean, its river basin covers nearly 40% of South America. This paper focuses on the middle-lower reach of the river, where seasonal flooding has formed large floodplain lakes along the riverbanks. The lakes regulate river flow, store nutrient-rich sediments and are home to diverse species.\n12 floodplain lakes along the middle-lower Amazon were studied, specifically investigating variations in their depths — in other words, their bathymetry. Bathymetry data is useful in different research applications, such as determining sedimentation patterns, or the influence of water seasonality on floodplain biodiversity.\nWhile bathymetry can be measured by boat surveys, this method is usually restricted to a small scale. On a larger scale, remote sensing is adopted, but reliance on light reflectance often results in less accurate measurements of cloudy water bodies like the Amazon lakes.\nConsidering the limitations of both methods, this paper uses a new method involving inundation frequency (IF), which refers to how often a certain part of a floodplain is flooded. As deeper parts of the floodplain would be flooded more frequently, the relationship between IF and depth can be modelled. Our new method is a versatile approach that could be applied to other rivers with sediment-rich, seasonally-inundated floodplain lakes.\n\nAng, W. J., Park, E., & Alcantara, E. (2021).

    "text": "As lake depth rises and falls with seasonal rainfall each year, the surface area of the lake grows and recedes correspondingly. One might expect a linear trend between these two variables, yet a complex cyclical relationship is observed. This phenomenon is termed hysteresis, and it controls the storage and exchange of water and sediments.\nWhile hysteresis has been repeatedly observed in the floodplain lakes of large rivers, the hydrological mechanism and factors in control have been poorly understood thus far. In this paper, we investigate the role of geomorphology in controlling lake hysteresis.\nWe study the floodplain lakes along three large rivers: the Curuai Lake of the Amazon River, the Tonle Sap Lake of the Mekong River, and the Poyang Lake of the Yangtze River. The three lakes exhibit a similar counter-clockwise hysteresis: for a given depth, the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season.\nOur results indicate that hysteresis is mainly controlled by geomorphology, where the lake shape and basin size lead to delays in the drainage and drop in lake area during the falling season. While geomorphology is the overall driver, unique lake characteristics delay the fall in water extent and shape hysteresis on a case-by-case nature.\nThis study is the first to address geomorphology as the primary control over lake hysteresis, which improves understanding of the stage-area curve in empirical and numerical hydrological models, and potentially floodplain management.\n\nAng, W.

    "text": "This project explores the possibility of a horizontal and vertical Amazon through a tactile crochet piece. The Amazon is typically seen horizontally in plan, like a vast stitchwork of interconnected ecosystems, floating communities, and complex geomorphology shaped over space and time. However, the Amazon can be reimagined vertically in section, as a three-layered system comprising the Voadores, the Amazon, and the Hamza.\nThe Voadores – meaning flying in Portuguese – is based on the unique existence of a sky river in the Amazon, where transpiration from the rainforest allows the river basin to create its own climate system. The Hamza, named after a researcher who proposed an underground river parallel to the Amazon, represents a massive slow-moving aquifer beneath the surface. This aquifer absorbs moisture, but also feeds back into the Amazon, sustaining its flow.\nThe crochet stitches reflect the distinct characteristics and direction of wetness in each layer. The Voadores is based on the “popcorn” clouds of the rainforest, with stitches in multiple directions, representing winds converging at the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The Amazon layer is like a flowing river with mainly horizontal stitches, and the Hamza resembles a soaked sponge with a downward direction. The piece transitions from the static Hamza to the dynamic Voadores, while the Amazon in between is cyclical, mimicking the rising and falling rhythm of the river."
